# K-Lang

[Our GitHub](https://github.com/kscalelabs/klang)

Klang is a domain-specific language (DSL) for programming robots. Here, we are working on our parser with Rust. From this, we will hopefully allow users to be able to write Klang code that can be compiled into motor control commands for our robots.

Think Midjourney --- we want users to be able to apply various tags for our model to understand implicitly and generate motor control commands.
