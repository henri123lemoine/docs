# K-Scale Labs

Welcome to K-Scale Labs!

We work on open source projects for humanoid robotics, whether working with NVIDIA Jetson kernels, machine learning research projects, or building platforms to make robotics more accessible.

Many of the projects here are a work in progress. If you are looking to contribute, please check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/kscalelabs) and reach out to us on [X](https://x.com/kscalelabs).

Feel free to make pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/kscalelabs/docs/tree/master) to help us improve our documentation ;).
