# K-Scale Labs Robotics Hackathon (August 31st)

We are a humanoid company in Palo Alto, focused on creating powerful, useful, and open source humanoids. We love robots. Come build something cool and make tangible progress on your robotics project! Overnight accommodations provided on a case-by-case basis - priority if you don't live nearby. You're welcome to bring your own tent / mattress pad as well.

Bring your existing robot! We encourage working on and demonstrating your projects.
