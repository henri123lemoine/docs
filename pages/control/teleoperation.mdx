# Teleoperation

Or, how to control a robot remotely in real-time. At K-Scale Labs, we've created a system for bi-manual remote robotic teleoperation.

## Key Features

Our bi-manual remote robotic teleoperation system includes:

- VR and browser visualization
- Bi-manual hand gesture control
- Camera streaming (mono + stereo)
- Inverse kinematics
- Support for Meta Quest Pro HMD and NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Orin™ Developer Kit
- `.urdf` robot model integration
- end effector control
- Real-world robot testing
- Trajectory recording and playback

## System Components

### Hardware
- **Stompy/Stompy Mini**: Humanoid with two manipulator arms
- **VR Headset**: Meta Quest Pro HMD for hand tracking and visualization
- **Compute Unit**: NVIDIA® Jetson Orin Nano 8GB Developer Kit for processing

### Software
- **Visualization**: Vuer for real-time robot state visualization
- **Inverse Kinematics**: PyBullet for calculating robot arm positions
- **Networking**: ngrok for secure tunneling

## How It Works

1. The operator wears a VR headset (Meta Quest Pro) which tracks their hand movements.
2. These movements are translated into control signals for the robot's arms.
3. The robot's camera feed is streamed back to the operator's headset, providing visual feedback.
4. Inverse kinematics calculations ensure the robot's movements match the operator's intentions.
5. The system supports both real-time control and the ability to record and playback trajectories.

## Future Developments

Our team is actively working on improving the system, with plans to:

- Implement 6DOF end effector control
- Enhance the stability and precision of hand tracking
- Expand compatibility with different robot models
- Improve latency in long-distance operations
