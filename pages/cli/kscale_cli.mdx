# The `kscale` CLI

The `kscale` CLI is what we use to interact with the [K-Scale store](https://kscale.store/). This will allow for users to download and upload URDF files completely through our CLI or through our website, with support for auto-fetching the latest version of URDF and mesh files from continually updating Onshape documents.

## Usage

```
kscale <subcommand> [options]
```

Where `<subcommand>` is either `urdf` or `pybullet`.

## Subcommands

### 1. URDF

The `urdf` subcommand allows you to manage URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files in the K-Scale store.

Usage:
```
kscale urdf <command> <listing_id> [options]
```

Available commands:

- `download`: Download a URDF artifact from the K-Scale store.
- `info`: Display information about a URDF artifact.
- `upload`: Upload a URDF artifact to the K-Scale store.
- `remove-local`: Remove locally cached URDF files.

#### Examples:

1. Download a URDF:
   ```
   kscale urdf download <listing_id>
   ```

2. Get URDF information:
   ```
   kscale urdf info <listing_id>
   ```

3. Upload a URDF:
   ```
   kscale urdf upload <listing_id> <folder_path>
   ```

4. Remove local URDF cache:
   ```
   kscale urdf remove-local <listing_id>
   ```
   To remove all local caches, use `all` as the listing_id.

### 2. PyBullet

The `pybullet` subcommand allows interaction with PyBullet functionalities. The specific commands and options for this subcommand are not provided in the given code snippet.

Usage:
```
kscale pybullet [options]
```

For detailed information on the available commands and options for the `pybullet` subcommand, please refer to the `pybullet.py` file or run:
```
kscale pybullet --help
```

## Notes

- The CLI uses asynchronous operations for improved performance.
- An API key is required for certain operations. Set it as the `KSCALE_API_KEY` environment variable or in your config file.
- The CLI uses a local cache to store downloaded artifacts. The cache location can be configured in the settings.

For more detailed information on each command and its options, use the `--help` flag with any command or subcommand.
